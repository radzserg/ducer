# Motivation

This package is an extension of the [rs-db-seeder](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rs-db-seeder) idea. While rs-db-seeder
works at a low level, directly writing data to the database, Ducer works at the API level allowing to fill in data
in the same way as the real application does.

- ability to generate data as close as possible to real conditions
- ability to play complex data scenarios
- ability to easily tweak data at different levels of nesting
- ability to easily obtain (if necessary) all generated data from different levels of nesting.
